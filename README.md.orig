## CodePath Prework - Tip Calculator 

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the third iteration of the TipCalculator app in Swift. I will be making more updates when I have some down time.

This is the second iteration of the TipCalculator app in Swift. I added a first responder, cleaner seperated classes for the User Defaults code to lessen repetitiveness, and themes in the setting page. I'll be adding more features in the next iteration.
